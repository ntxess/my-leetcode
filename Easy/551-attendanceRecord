// 551. Student Attendance Record I
// You are given a string s representing an attendance record for a student where each character 
// signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains 
// the following three characters:

// 'A': Absent.
// 'L': Late.
// 'P': Present.
// The student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet both of the following criteria:

// The student was absent ('A') for strictly fewer than 2 days total.
// The student was never late ('L') for 3 or more consecutive days.
// Return true if the student is eligible for an attendance award, or false otherwise.
