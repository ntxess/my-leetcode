// 441. Arranging Coins
// You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows 
// where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.
// Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.
