// 771. Jewels and Stones
// You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have.
// Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
// Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
