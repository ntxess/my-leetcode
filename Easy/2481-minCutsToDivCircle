// 2481. Minimum Cuts to Divide a Circle
// A valid cut in a circle can be:
// A cut that is represented by a straight line that touches two points on the edge of the circle and passes through its center, or
// A cut that is represented by a straight line that touches one point on the edge of the circle and its center.
// Some valid and invalid cuts are shown in the figures below.
