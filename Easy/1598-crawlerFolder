// 1598. Crawler Log Folder
// The Leetcode file system keeps a log each time some user performs a change folder operation.
// The operations are described below:
// "../" : Move to the parent folder of the current folder. (If you are already in the main folder, remain in the same folder).
// "./" : Remain in the same folder.
// "x/" : Move to the child folder named x (This folder is guaranteed to always exist).
// You are given a list of strings logs where logs[i] is the operation performed by the user at the ith step.
// The file system starts in the main folder, then the operations in logs are performed.
// Return the minimum number of operations needed to go back to the main folder after the change folder operations.
