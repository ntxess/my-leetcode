// 944. Delete Columns to Make Sorted
// You are given an array of n strings strs, all of the same length.
// The strings can be arranged such that there is one on each line, making a grid.
// For example, strs = ["abc", "bce", "cae"] can be arranged as follows:
// abc
// bce
// cae
// You want to delete the columns that are not sorted lexicographically. In the above example 
// (0-indexed), columns 0 ('a', 'b', 'c') and 2 ('c', 'e', 'e') are sorted, while column 1 ('b', 'c', 'a') 
// is not, so you would delete column 1.
// Return the number of columns that you will delete.
