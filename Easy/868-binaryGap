// 868. Binary Gap
// Given a positive integer n, find and return the longest distance between any two adjacent 1's in the binary representation of n. If there are no two adjacent 1's, return 0.
// Two 1's are adjacent if there are only 0's separating them (possibly no 0's). The distance between two 1's is the 
// absolute difference between their bit positions. For example, the two 1's in "1001" have a distance of 3.
