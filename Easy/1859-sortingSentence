// 1859. Sorting the Sentence
// A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters.
// A sentence can be shuffled by appending the 1-indexed word position to each word then rearranging the words in the sentence.
// For example, the sentence "This is a sentence" can be shuffled as "sentence4 a3 is2 This1" or "is2 sentence4 This1 a3".
// Given a shuffled sentence s containing no more than 9 words, reconstruct and return the original sentence.
